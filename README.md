# ðŸ’³ Java Bank Account Simulation

A beginner-friendly Java console application that simulates simple bank account operations like deposit, withdrawal, balance check, and transaction history. Perfect for learning and practicing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java.

---

## ðŸ“„ Description

This project demonstrates how a basic banking system works through a **menu-driven CLI** (Command Line Interface) built using core Java concepts.

Key functionality includes:

- Creating an account with name, number, and starting balance
- Performing **deposits** and **withdrawals** with input validation
- Viewing **real-time balance**
- Checking **transaction history**
- Implementing control structures like `do-while` and `switch`
